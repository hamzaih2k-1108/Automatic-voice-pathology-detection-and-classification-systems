# Automatic voice-pathology detection and classification systems
 Automatic voice-pathology detection and classification systems may help clinicians to detect the exis tence of any voice pathologies and the type of pathology from which patients suffer in the early stages Voice pathologies affect the vocal folds, producing irregular vibrations due to the malfunctioning of many factors contributing to vocal vibrations. In addition, voice pathologies affect vocal-fold vibration differently depending on the type of disorder and the location of the disease in the vocal folds, making them produce different basic tones.

## The first step : Pre-emphasis
>Apply a pre-emphasis filter on signal to amplify the high frequencies. A pre emphasis filer is usful in several ways:
- balance frequency spectrum  since high frequencies usually have smaller magnitudes compared to lower frequencies
- avoid numerical problems during fourier operatio
- Might also improve the signal to Noise Ratio (SNR)

## The second step : Fourier-transform

## The third step : Build CNN model

## The final step : Evaluate the model
